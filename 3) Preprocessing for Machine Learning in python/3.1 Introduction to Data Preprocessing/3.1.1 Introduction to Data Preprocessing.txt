# What is data Preprocessing ?      
              
- After exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning   
- Preparing data for modeling      
                     
**Example**: Transforming categorical features into numerical features (dummy variables)

# Why preprocess      

- Transform dataset so it's suitable for modeling           
- Improve model performance    
- Improve more reliable results
